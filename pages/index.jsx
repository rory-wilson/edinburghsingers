                                    The Edinburgh Singers is one of the City's finest non-professional
                                    auditioned mixed-voice choirs. It is renowned for vibrant, moving
                                    and expressive performances of music from the Early Baroque to the
                                    present day. Founded more than 60 years ago, the choir remains an
                                    enthusiastic sociable group of all ages and from every walk of life.

                                    In recent years, the choir has considerably extended its repertoire both
                                    chronologically and stylistically.We have performed Renaissance and medieval
                                    pieces along with major works by 19th to 21st century composers such as Parry,
                                    Stamford, Finzi, Kod√°ly, Widor, Walton, Poulenc, Rutter, Tavener and MacMillan,
                                    in addition to more familiar choral works by Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mozart,
                                    Mendelssohn, Faure and Elgar. It is a measure of the quality of the choir
                                    that it not only rises to these challenges, but also provides soloists from
                                    within its ranks for all but the largest oratorios.

                                    Typically the choir performs four formal concerts each year, in major venues in
                                    the centre of Edinburgh, and often in the atmospheric surroundings of
                                    Greyfriars Kirk. In recent years the choir has toured to Munich,
                                    Tuscany, Rome, Paris and Berlin, and performed in Brussels and Ghent in April 2019.
